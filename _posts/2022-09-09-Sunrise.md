### Dawn
First rays coming through. I had been wanting to start my own blog for a while now. Procastination took the better part of me. But finally the sunrise is coming out!

A blog was required for one of my classes and I took this as an opportunity to nudge myself to starting this blog. The class Software Construction, Design and Architecture seems to be a promising one, pushing me out of my comfort zone already.

On top of that, the class involves application from most of the classes that I have taken before. It is therefore a good opportunity put into action skills and ideas that I have taken up from classes before. Like a chef picking out the finest ingridients to make a scrumptous meal.

### Tags
I have not learnt how to tag the blogs yet, but I am hoping that with time I will be able to do so.
