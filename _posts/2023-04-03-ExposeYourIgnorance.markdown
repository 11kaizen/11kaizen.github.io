The authors introduce this pattern of Exposing your ignorance, in this pattern they talk about the expectations that the world has especially those in the workplace have of you. They expect you to have a degree of competence and boldness of the tasks that you are assigned. However, deep within you lack the expertise and the know how of doing what you have been tasked to do. You therefore land in a cross-roads. In this cross-roads you have an option to shed light to your weakness through asking questions and letting your team members and others around you to know that you are learning or, you have an option of hiding your inadequacy.

As we discover new technologies and have to let go of all that we have learnt we become exposed as we are making new paths in our lives. The authors recommend that the best way to overcome your ignorance is to ask questions. Even though asking question might point that you are incompetent it give you an opportunity to learn. Learning to learn allows people to see you in you journey as you grow from apprentice to master. 

By following this path of exposing your ingnorance you will be able to learn so much more technologies and expose yourself to more skills. The authors then call us to action to list down five things that don't really understand about your work.
## Reflection
I like the principle of this pattern as it encourages us to face our weaknesses and faults. Something that most of us are not used to doing. I believe that exposing our ignorance allows us to learn the right way. By exposing our ignorance we get a chance to understand waht we are dealing with right down straight to the root of the problem be it internal or external problems. 
I belive that this will be an important principle heading into the work world and even as we ascend the height of our careers. It will give me an opportunity to grasp core concepts and even the ability to do better even as I continue to progress.
