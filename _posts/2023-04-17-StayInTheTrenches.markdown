## Summary
This pattern applies to those who have continued to master their skills. They have been noticed by the management and because of working exceptionally they are offered a promotion, a reward that takes them higher within their company. Even though the opportunity looks lucrative there is a downside to the open door. You end up programming less and you get diverted from your goal of becoming a master at your skills. The author's recommend sticking to your current position. Instead of accepting opportunities that might lead you further away from your goal, you can request for a pay rise or become an "internal consultant". This will allow you to still follow your goals while at the same time accepting reward for your hard work. Even though it might seem selfish for that duration it might help you become a more experience programmer and you can in turn help out more workers. As an alternative you can take up the position and work with the other pattern, using your title. Either way you have to have the end goal in mind of where you intend to be.
## Reflection
Staying in the trenches was a pretty unique pattern advising us to go contrary to what might look attractive or flashy. In this age that we live in being promoted or going higher in rank especially at your work place is considered a big step. However, being determined enough to focus on what is coming ahead and saying no to a promotion is of a more honrable course. The lure of success might easily lead one from fully realizing their potential. It is improtant to make the right call at different point in your life and this is determined by what your goal is. It's therefore a good reminder that based of the goals that you have set in life you might be required to make huge sacrifices including saying no inorder to lock in on the goals that you have set in life It's therefore a good reminder that based of the goals that you have set in life you might be required to make huge sacrifices including saying no inorder to lock in on the goals that you have set in life.
